# Remph

Are you tired of being the only leader stepping up to handle bookkeeping? So are we. Do you wish you actually received notifications from your boss calls board? We can help with that. Has your community had drama from a leader mis-entering points? We've been there. Are you scared to change your DKP system because it's a hassle to transfer everything over? We understand. We are clan leaders making a platform that seamlessly fills the gaps. That's why we are making Remph.

The glue of MMO guilds, clans, and communities. Remph integrates with your existing DKP system to organize your DKP, facilitate your admin work, and handle the small things so you don't need to.

Remph is currently in development. If you are interested in getting notified when we open for testing, reach out!
